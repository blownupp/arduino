Random code snippets for the Arduino platform

This is just a place where I'll share code that I'm working on, be it in Lua for the ESP8266, in Python on the Raspberry Pi or C++ for Arduino. Quick warning though, I'm very new to programming, so be kind :)

I welcome pull requests or wiki edits, this is all about learning after all!
